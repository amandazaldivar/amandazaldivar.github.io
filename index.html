<p> <h1> Amanda Zaldivar: <br> Creative Computing </h1> </p>
<h3> Welcome to my online collection of the projects in my Creative Computing class! Feel free to browse. </h3>


<ul>

<li> <a href="https://amandazaldivar.github.io/interview/">Interview Website</a> 
	<p> Here, the class held one on one interviews, and compiled all of our data to make individual websites. With basic HTML and CSS, I constructed a simple website with everybody's interview. </p> 
</li>
<li> <a href="https://amandazaldivar.github.io/psa">Public Service Announcement</a> 
	<p> In this assignment, we were tasked to create a webpage that informs the public about an issue. With no imagery allowed, and expanding on CSS skills, I made a PSA focusing on annoying tourists getting in the way in the New York City streets.  </p> 
</li>
<li> <a href="https://amandazaldivar.github.io/iteration_1">JavaScript Composition--Iteration 1</a> 
	<p>Here, we began to learn about the possibilities of JavaScript. We were told to make a beautiful composition.</p> 
</li>
<li> <a href="https://amandazaldivar.github.io/iteration_2">JavaScript Composition-- Iteration 2</a>
	<p> Expanding off of my first composition, I added a new element: random dots that change position with every refresh. </p>
	 </li>
<li> <a href="https://amandazaldivar.github.io/iteration_3">JavaScript Composition-- Iteration 3</a>
	<p>My third and final iteration: the center circle grows by the second, and then restarts at the minute mark. </p> 
 </li>

</ul>
