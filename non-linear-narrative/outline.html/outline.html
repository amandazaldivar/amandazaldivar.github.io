	<p> <h3> Sam?</h3> </p>
	<p> <h6> the game </h6> </p>
	<p> <h5> For this game, your task is to find my little sister, Samantha. </h5> </p>
	<p> First, you'll arrive at my house. You're me, and you're home for Thanksgiving break! You'll talk to my mom and my dad, and greet our dog, but Sam is nowhere to be found. You'll have to search the whole house, and ask my parents where she is. You'll be navigating through our house and outdoors a little, making decisions and clicking on different sections of photographs to move around. You'll run into complications, though: maybe Mom needs help with the turkey, maybe Dad needs you to walk our dog. But you need to find her before dinner time! </p>
